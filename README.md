# BrainMRI: Deep Learning for Brain Tumor Detection üß†üìä

**BrainMRI** is a comprehensive deep learning-based solution for detecting brain tumors using MRI scans. This project implements pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for binary (tumor vs. no tumor) and multi-class (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor) classification tasks. The models used include **InceptionV3**, **ResNet-50**, **VGG-16**, **MobileNetV2**, and **DenseNet121**, optimized for accuracy and efficiency.
